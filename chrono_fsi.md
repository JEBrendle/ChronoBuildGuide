Chrono FSI Module:
Note: CMake 3.5.2 and GCC 4.9.4 were used to build Chrono.

1. Check the box next to ENABLE_MODULE_FSI.
2. Click on Configure.
3. Click on Generate.
4. Go to the directory that you decided to build Chrono in and run a “make” command.
5. Become a super user and run a “make install” command.
6. The FSI module will be for use after this, but it should be noted that to run the full capability of the FSI module, it will be necessary to enable the Chrono Parallel module and download NVIDIA drivers.
